# 1. Why should we study Blockchain?

**Look at the image of 2008 financial crisis**

**What was the root cause of the global financial crisis in 2008?**

The Biggest Culprit: The Lenders

Most of the blame is on the mortgage originators or the lenders. That's because they were responsible for creating these problems. After all, the lenders were the ones who advanced loans to people with poor credit and a high risk of default

The Global Financial Crisis of 2007-2008 had far-reaching impacts. It catalyzed an implosion of trust in a number of institutions: the commercial banks whose business practices caused the crisis; the central banks that never saw it coming; and the governments that failed to address it effectively or hold the most irresponsible and negligent individuals to account. Indeed, much of the wrongdoing would never have come to light without citizen journalists and whistleblowers. The drawbacks of centralized power became more evident, as did the power of technology.


So we can say ...

### Identify the reason why blockchain is the best solution for the future ?

Whenever we purchase something from any website, what do we know, that it will be the same item from the same shop that we ordered. If we donate to any NGO, can we be sure that money is going to that NGO and not to any other? Who is giving that guarantee?

For that purpose, blockchain is the best solution. It is a decentralized system that allows us to store and share data without any middlemen. We are going to share many things later on.

# 2. What is Blockchain Technology?

### Who invented blockchain in 1991?
Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta envisioned what many people have come to know as blockchain, in 1991. Their first work involved working on a cryptographically secured chain of blocks whereby no one could tamper with timestamps of documents.

                </p>

### Satoshi Nakamoto ?

Nakamoto was the one who mined the first blockchain of Bitcoin and was the one who published the whitepaper for the digital currency. Nakamoto had envisioned Bitcoin to be a token of transaction that would be widely adopted by the world to protect against inflation.

        </p>

Blockchain is a distributed ledger that is a collection of records, called blocks, that are linked together by cryptography.


### Example of Blockchain in Real Life

<p align="center">
        <img src="https://github.com/Subham-Maity/Blockchain-Book-vol2/blob/master/Image%20Ignore/6.gif?raw=true "  width="200px"/>
        </p>


Let's say I purchase something from an offline store, and I have a ledger in which I can record the details of the purchase, and that ledger was created by the store. Now if the shopkeeper manipulates the ledger, I can't do anything.


But in the case of blockchain, Shopkeeper can't manipulate the ledger, because the ledger is linked to the blockchain ,and it is immutable.If the shopkeeper try to manipulate the ledger, you can easily find out someone is trying to tamper with the ledger ,and you can easily stop him.

# Applications of Blockchain Technology 

### 1. Product Tracking

Blockchain could also help verify the authenticity of imported raw
materials, such as nuts, cocoa and coffee. "In Denmark, we don't have good
documentation of raw materials we import," Høgh Jensen explained. This is
because long supply chains-where food manufacturers are purchasing
from suppliers rather than primary producers-don't always come with
detailed documentation.

For that reason, blockchain could be used to track the raw materials

**The Technical University of Denmark is developing blockchain solutions for small and medium-sized food manufacturers in an effort to combat food fraud in high-value products.**

### 2. Smart Contracts

<p align="center">
        <img src="https://github.com/Subham-Maity/Blockchain-Book-vol2/blob/master/Image%20Ignore/7.gif?raw=true "  width="200px"/>
        </p>

- smart contracts are a set of rules that are executed by a smart contract
- smart contracts are run on the ethereum blockchain

#### Real World Example
<p align="center">
        <img src="https://github.com/Subham-Maity/Blockchain-Book-vol2/blob/master/Image%20Ignore/8.jpg?raw=true "  width="200px"/>
        </p>
The shop looks like this – you pay first and then the guy hands you your stuff.

You pay him for the instant noodles, and you find that the shopkeeper just sits back down on his chair and does nothing.

* “Give me the noodles!”

* “Sure, that’ll be ₹20.”

* “I just paid you!”

* “When? No, you didn’t.”

Other than calling the police or starting a fight, you would have no recourse.
<p align="center">
        <img src="https://github.com/Subham-Maity/Blockchain-Book-vol2/blob/master/Image%20Ignore/9.gif?raw=true "  width="200px"/>
        </p>

The problem here was that you had to trust a human to do his part after you did yours.

While people generally do their part in an implied contract like this one (the contract here was “I give you the stuff after you pay me”), relying on humans to be honest is not an ironclad solution and people get cheated every once in a while.

(Note: Smart contract is just a marketing term for computer programs. It has absolutely nothing to do with a legal contract. Do not relate smart contracts with contracts in a legal sense.)

You would preferably want to take away this element of having to trust this shopkeeper to hold his end of the bargain.

You want to use a system that takes your money and then gives you what you want for sure (a type of contract where you don’t have to trust anybody).

Here, it would be a vending machine.

<p align="center">

You can buy as many canned slow poisons as you want without having to trust anybody.

You put your money in, you get the stuff you want. You don’t put your money in, you don’t get the stuff you want. You put extra money in, you get change.

You don’t have to trust anybody – it’s an automatic machine that does as it’s programmed to do and nothing else.

(To those of you thinking, what if the machine is malfunctioning – these are all vagaries of the real world. In the world of code, you don’t have to think about this. The program will execute exactly as written.)

The vending machine is a real world example of a smart contract.

It is a software (in this case, real world machinery) executing its code (in this case, giving you the item when you put in money).

That’s it: A smart contract is just a fancy word for a piece of code that automatically executes something in a predetermined way. This piece of code is stored and executed in a distributed/decentralized manner (more on that later).

They are mainly used to reduce the need for a trusted intermediary, disputes, and frauds.

I repeat: it has nothing to do with contracts in the legal sense.

In fact, smart contracts aren’t smart at all. They are just pieces of code that execute exactly as written. For example, if a well-known billionaire is extremely thirsty and offers to pay a million dollars for a drink, it would be smart to take it. But… the vending machine won’t take it, because it hasn’t been explicitly programmed to do so. 

### 3. International Wire Transfer

#### Disadvantages of the centralized banking system:
- Huge fees while transferring money from one bank to another (e.g. $10 for every $1 transferred)
- Time taken to transfer money is long

#### How Blockchain Could Disrupt Banking
Blockchain technology offers a secure and cheap way of sending payments that cuts down on the need for verification from third parties and beats processing times for traditional bank transfers. 90% of members of the European Payments Council believe blockchain technology will fundamentally change the industry by 2025

**Example:** 

Taipei, April 12, 2021 – Global financial services firm J.P. Morgan today announced that it is using blockchain technology to improve funds transfers between banking institutions globally, including payments originating from Taiwan banks to beneficiary banks in other markets. Through improved information exchange related to such payments, the new solution called Confirm is expected to help reduce the number of rejected or returned transactions caused by mismatched payment details, lowering costs for both the sending and receiving banks.

### 4. Healthcare System

Blockchain can be a perfect technology for record-keeping in the medical world. Its applications include sharing healthcare data, keeping electronic healthcare records, managing insurance, and performing administrative tasks. Patients can send their health information via an app to a Blockchain Network.


if that patient store his all medical issue related data store in one block and can be accessed by other hospital and doctor then it save many times and cost.
