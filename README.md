# 1. Why should we study Blockchain?

**Look at the image of 2008 financial crisis**

**What was the root cause of the global financial crisis in 2008?**

The Biggest Culprit: The Lenders

Most of the blame is on the mortgage originators or the lenders. That's because they were responsible for creating these problems. After all, the lenders were the ones who advanced loans to people with poor credit and a high risk of default

The Global Financial Crisis of 2007-2008 had far-reaching impacts. It catalyzed an implosion of trust in a number of institutions: the commercial banks whose business practices caused the crisis; the central banks that never saw it coming; and the governments that failed to address it effectively or hold the most irresponsible and negligent individuals to account. Indeed, much of the wrongdoing would never have come to light without citizen journalists and whistleblowers. The drawbacks of centralized power became more evident, as did the power of technology.


So we can say ...

### Identify the reason why blockchain is the best solution for the future ?

Whenever we purchase something from any website, what do we know, that it will be the same item from the same shop that we ordered. If we donate to any NGO, can we be sure that money is going to that NGO and not to any other? Who is giving that guarantee?

For that purpose, blockchain is the best solution. It is a decentralized system that allows us to store and share data without any middlemen. We are going to share many things later on.

# 2. What is Blockchain Technology?

### Who invented blockchain in 1991?
Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta envisioned what many people have come to know as blockchain, in 1991. Their first work involved working on a cryptographically secured chain of blocks whereby no one could tamper with timestamps of documents.

### Satoshi Nakamoto ?

Nakamoto was the one who mined the first blockchain of Bitcoin and was the one who published the whitepaper for the digital currency. Nakamoto had envisioned Bitcoin to be a token of transaction that would be widely adopted by the world to protect against inflation.

Blockchain is a distributed ledger that is a collection of records, called blocks, that are linked together by cryptography.


### Example of Blockchain in Real Life

Let's say I purchase something from an offline store, and I have a ledger in which I can record the details of the purchase, and that ledger was created by the store. Now if the shopkeeper manipulates the ledger, I can't do anything.


But in the case of blockchain, Shopkeeper can't manipulate the ledger, because the ledger is linked to the blockchain ,and it is immutable.If the shopkeeper try to manipulate the ledger, you can easily find out someone is trying to tamper with the ledger ,and you can easily stop him.
